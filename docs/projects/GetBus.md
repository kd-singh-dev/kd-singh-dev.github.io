## Introduction

* Built redbus from scratch in under 2 days. This included implementing dynamic pricing for bus routes, a payment gateway, invoice generation, and selecting relevant seats, discount codes, and an admin dashboard.
* Modified it to a movie ticket booking system in just one da. Additionally, integrated S3 buckets for storing movie posters, it involved setting up bucket policy and also ensuring that the images are not downloadable or to be open in other tab.
* Integrated the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for centralized logging, analysis and monitoring.
* Dockerized the app, deploying it, and accessed the long file generated using Docker volume in real-time in order to feed it into Kibana for visualization.
