## üëã Introduction
The idea for downstream evolved from Three different apps let's first discuss them separately.

## üí° Idea Discussion 

### First inspiration

>**[ProtectText.com](protecttext.com)**

**the basic idea is to Enter any URL, e.g. protectedText.com/anything if available - it's yours!**

This allows protecttext.com to be opened in one single click and start making notes without any long signing up forms and signing in every single time one enters. One simply enters the link sent a password and it's done. This allows maintaining user's privacy

- this is the easiest way to store text online in just one click
- The safest site on the web for storing your text!
- Enter any URL, e.g. protectedText.com/anything You find it - it's yours!
- Encrypt all your notes, access them anywhere. 
- Simple. Fast. Free. No ads. Secure.


### Second Inspiration

> ** [codeshare](https://codeshare.io/)**

**Share Code in Real-time with Developers**

- codeshare allocates one link to one code user can share and which can be accessed by anyone in real-time allowing teams to collaborate.

### Third Inspiration

>**[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)**

- A real time doc editor
- no need to keep saving
- can be accessed from everywhere
- allows user to collaborate

## üìÉ DocStream
DocStream full form is Document Stream, as name suggest DocStream allows **users to host their documents, allows access from anywhere, allws team mates to collaborate in real time.**
