## Introduction 👀

This site is build to show my work and discuss myself in a more user-friendly way. This site holds my interest, hobbies, my projects, and social links.

This portfolio site is build using React and docusaurus. Docusaurus helps you to move fast and write content. Build documentation websites, blogs, marketing pages, and more.

- Docusaurus supports Markdown integration thus allows me to make changes to my website easily.
- This site use cookies to store the theme of the site which visitors like.
- Loading time has been minimized using react thus the site needs to be loaded just once.
- Dark theam available
- I tried to show information in code format, I spend most of my time coding. Extra information is stored in form of documentation that is easy to read and can be navigated easily   by links given on the sidebars.
