The `react` package helps us to integrate AgileTs into a [React](https://reactjs.org/) environment
and serves as an Interface to React.
Its main task is to bind States to React Components.
This binding ensures that AgileTs rerender the Component whenever a bound State mutates.
It also offers some other valuable functionalities that optimize the workflow using AgileTs in a React project.

A distinction is made between `Functional` and `Class` Components.
As we prefer to use [`React Hooks`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) in Functional Components
but Hooks aren't supported in Class Components.
Therefore, we have created alternatives for Class Components in order to offer the same functionalities there as well.

### üêÜ Functional Component
In Functional Components we recommend using AgileTs Hooks like [`useAgile()`](./features/Hooks.md#useagile).
The `useAgile()` Hook binds [Agile Sub Instances](https://agile-ts.org/docs/introduction#agile-sub-instance) (like States or Collections) to React Components.
```ts
// -- myComponent.jsx ------------------------------------------

// Binds MY_FIRST_STATE to myComponent
const myFirstState = useAgile(MY_FIRST_STATE);
```
To find out more about `useAgile()`, and other Hooks provided by AgileTs,
checkout the [AgileTs Hook documentation](https://agile-ts.org/docs/react/hooks).

### ü¶ñ Class Component
For Class Components, we provide the `AgileHOC`.
The `AgileHOC` is a Higher Order Component that is wrapped around a React Component.
It takes care of binding [Agile Sub Instances](https://agile-ts.org/docs/introduction#agile-sub-instance) (like States or Collections) to the wrapped React Component.
```ts
// -- myComponent.jsx ------------------------------------------

// Binds MY_FIRST_STATE to myComponent
export default AgileHOC(myComponent, [MY_FIRST_STATE]);
```
To find out more about the `AgileHOC` and AgileTs in Class Components,
checkout the [AgileHOC documentation](https://agile-ts.org/docs/react/AgileHOC).

```
npm install @agile-ts/react
```
The `react` package is an extension of AgileTs and doesn't work without the [`core`](https://agile-ts.org/docs/core) package,
which functions as the brain of AgileTs and is indispensable.
Unfortunately, we can't combine each `core` with `react` version.
Therefore, we have created a table that shows which versions fit together without restrictions.

| @agile-ts/react | @agile-ts/core          | NPM Version              | Supported React versions | Supports hook based components    |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------|---------------------------------- |
| v0.0.7+         | v0.0.7+                 | v6+                      | 16.8+                    | Yes                               |
| v0.0.6          | v0.0.3 - v0.0.6         | v6+                      | 16.8+                    | Yes                               | 

_Older Versions aren't supported anymore_
